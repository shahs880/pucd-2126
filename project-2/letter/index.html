            Dear Mumbai,<br><br>

            I love to hate you. Almost as much as I hate to love you. Frustratingly comfortable, youâ€™re both, home and somewhere I never want to be again. Traffic filled roads paved with endless memories that by default made me who I am. Familial ties somehow entangled in every moment.

            I might be cynical because I hated high school and the endless supply of over-smart, over-achieving,  . And I might be cynical because I hate crowds and people pushing me. And I might be cynical because loud noises make my brain hurt. And I might be cynical because and Bombay is all of the above amplified. But it also amplifies the good.

            Overt social classes of Bombay be damned. No-one is too good for Madras Cafe and the endless supply of South Indian food that it offers. I now consider myself lucky to live a 10 minute walk away from the best. It opens at 6 am to the people already lining up outside. Despite the rather pompous owner, Madras Cafe is a must.

            New York might just be as refined as you can get. The sounds here are from ambulances boasting good health care. Not dogs barking in the middle of the night because some idiot on a motorcycle drove too close to it. Not the sounds of 22 million impatient people honking as though their lives depended on it. But its also not the sound of the rain falling against your windscreen or the wind running through your hair as you drive along Marine Drive. 
        </p>

        <p>
              Being away from home makes you appreciate it. A forgotten memory of grabbing dinner with my father at Kala Ghoda Cafe reminds me that I might be closer to him than I thought. Spontaneous trips to Colaba Causeway, almost always followed by an endless drive home because we stayed too late and now its rush hour. Late nights sitting by Marine Drive while eating frozen yogurt remind me that maybe some memories are worth keeping.

        <p>
            And even though I might get frustrated with the city, it will always be a safe space. Filled with comfort food and overcrowded memories.
