            Definitely my happy place. The narrow, entangled streets hold some of my favorite places in the city. I remember my dad picking me up from SAT prep class in the middle of July. It was raining more than normal and the streets were flooding fast. We were stuck in traffic for a good half an hour and hadnâ€™t moved an inch. It was close to dinner time and we decided to wait the rai out at Kala Ghoda Cafe. I guess we were closer than I thought we were. Even after countless dinners at Mamagoto it is still my go-to for Asian in the city. A furniture shop, a Modern Art gallery, cafes, record stores and several small  boutiques crowd the lanes. Every February there is the Kala Ghoda Arts Festival with art and food stalls, installations and performance artists.

            <p>Mamagoto is a must. The Spicy Bangkok bowl and the Massaman curry are to die for.

            <p>Just walk around. Everything here is definitely more expensive.
